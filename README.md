# Gambina Hunter

## About

Out of curiosity, I tried to learn how to use [Ebitengine](https://ebitengine.org) and created this tiny game where my pixelated friend hunts for Gambina (Vermouth & Gin cocktail, his favorite). Comes with flavor of Duke Nukem sounds.

This won't raise more than eyebrows within AAA gamestudios, but **Ebitengine** seems fun and I will try to make some other game with it in the near future.
